 some of the arguments raised 
by the learned Counsel for the appellants can have absolutely no 
relevance, and the court must, of necessity, lean even more heavily

As a result in the aforesaid case Justice S.B.Sinha allowed the 
appeal of the accused persons while Justice H.S. Bedi dismissed the 
appeal. The case was referred to a larger bench due to the difference 
in opinion between the two judges.
